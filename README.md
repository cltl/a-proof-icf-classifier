# aproof-icf-classifier
Classifier that can read medical reports and assign a functional level classification following the WHO ICF classification scheme.

The classifier will read a CSV file row by and carry out the following actions:

<ol>
<li>load the ICF classifiers in memory
<li>for every row in the input CSV file:
  <ol>
<li>get the text field from the column "note"
<li>apply spaCy to the text to process the sentences and tokens
<li>for every sentence within the text:
  <ol>
<li>anonymize the sentence
<li>send the sentence to the ICF domain classifier
<li>for every domain generated by the classifier get the level from the level classifier
  </ol>
<li>aggregate the domains and levels across all sentences and obtain a domain level output at the note level
<li>save the note level levels in additional columns and save the row to the output file
</ol>
  </ol>
