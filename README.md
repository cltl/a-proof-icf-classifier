# aproof-icf-classifier
Classifier that can read medical reports and assign a functional level classification following the WHO ICF classification scheme.

The classifier will read a CSV file row by and carry out the following actions:

<ol>
<li>1. load the ICF classifiers in memory
<li>2. for every row in the input CSV file:
<li>2.1 get the text field from the column "note"
<li>2.2 apply spaCy to the text to process the sentences and tokens
<li>2.3 for every sentence within the text:
<li>2.3.1 anonymize the sentence
<li>2.3.2 send the sentence to the ICF domain classifier
<li>2.3.3 for every domain generated by the classifier get the level from the level classifier
<li>2.4 aggregate the domains and levels across all sentences and obtain a domain level output at the note level
<li>2.5 save the note level levels in additional columns and save the row to the output file
</ol>
